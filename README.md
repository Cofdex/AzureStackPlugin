# AzureStackPlugin

A multi-agent software delivery workflow for Azure Python projects. Provides 13 single-responsibility agents, 53 Azure SDK skills, and a continual-learning hook system — all orchestrated through a structured pipeline that covers feature delivery, bugfixes, refactoring, and security audits.

## Installation

```bash
copilot plugin install Cofdex/AzureStackPlugin
```

## Agents

13 agents, each with a single responsibility. The **Orchestrator** is the sole entry point — all requests are classified and routed from there.

| Agent | Role |
|---|---|
| `orchestrator` | Classifies requests, spawns agents, manages barriers, escalates blockers |
| `brainstorm` | Gathers requirements via Q&A with the user (feature-full path only) |
| `architecture` | Designs technical architecture from `brainstorm-report.md` |
| `planner` | Decomposes architecture into sprints; verifies each sprint after completion |
| `tdd-suite` | Writes failing pytest tests before implementation (red phase) |
| `implement` | Sole code author — writes production code to pass tests |
| `code-reviewer` | Reviews code quality, logic, and structure (per sprint, parallel) |
| `security` | Per-sprint security check — injection, secrets, auth, CVEs (parallel) |
| `debug` | Traces bugs to root cause, writes failing repro tests |
| `refactor-planner` | Plans behavior-preserving refactors in small, reversible sprints |
| `regression-tester` | Verifies no behavior change after each refactor sprint |
| `security-auditor` | Full security audit across SAST, secrets, dependencies, threat model |
| `reflection` | Records learnings and patterns after each committed sprint |

## Workflows

```
feature-full   Brainstorm → Architecture → Planner → [TDD] → Implement → [Review ∥ Security] → Reflection
feature-lite   Planner → Implement → [Review ∥ Security] → Reflection
bugfix         Debug → Planner → Implement → [Review ∥ Security] → Reflection
refactor       Refactor Planner → Implement → [Review ∥ Regression] → Reflection
security       Security Auditor (SAST ∥ Secrets ∥ Dependencies ∥ Threat Model) → consolidated report
hotfix         Implement → [Review ∥ SAST ∥ Secrets]
```

| Workflow | When |
|---|---|
| `feature-full` | > 2 modules, new external service, security implication, or > 3 days |
| `feature-lite` | Feature request not meeting `feature-full` criteria |
| `bugfix` | Incorrect behavior, reproducible |
| `refactor` | Structural change, no behavior change |
| `security` | Full or partial codebase audit |
| `hotfix` | Emergency patch, 1–2 files |

---

## Skills

53 Azure SDK skills loaded on-demand by the Implement Agent. Each skill provides correct SDK patterns, auth idioms, and error handling for its service.

## Python Tooling

This plugin uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for Python package management and test execution.

Install dependencies:
```bash
uv add <package>
```

Run tests:
```bash
uv run pytest
```

---

## Continual Learning

A hook system persists cross-session knowledge to SQLite:

- **Global** (`~/.copilot/learnings.db`) — patterns across all projects
- **Local** (`.copilot-memory/learnings.db`) — patterns specific to this repo

Hooks fire at `sessionStart` (loads prior knowledge), `postToolUse` (logs outcomes), and `sessionEnd` (analyzes patterns, compacts data).

---

## Quality Hooks

### Lint on code generation

Runs [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) automatically after every code edit. Fails immediately so the AI agent can fix issues before moving on.

### Coverage gate (pre-commit)

Blocks `git commit` if test coverage is below **80%**. Requires `pytest-cov`.

### Installation

Copy both hook sets into your project:

```bash
cp -r hooks/continual-learning .github/hooks/
cp -r hooks/quality .github/hooks/
chmod +x .github/hooks/quality/lint.sh
```

Install the git pre-commit hook:

```bash
cp hooks/quality/pre-commit.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

Install coverage dependency:

```bash
uv add --dev pytest-cov ruff
```

To bypass the coverage gate in an emergency:

```bash
SKIP_COVERAGE=true git commit -m "..."
```
